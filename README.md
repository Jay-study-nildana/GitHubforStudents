# Preparing for the Workshop

1. You should have never ever tried to install Git tools on your PC or Mac. Just like your mind, your computer should be completely free of any git things. 
1. If you have already experimented with git tools, then, please reset your computer before coming to the workshop.
1. Another option is, you can install virtual machine on your computer, which can act like a brand new computer.

# Essential Software 

Note: windows users need not install this before coming to workshop. we can do this in the class, no problem.

Note: Mac people, YOU HAVE TO INSTALL the tools before coming to workshop. This is because it takes 2 to 6 hours to install XCode. So, you cannot do this after coming to the workshop.
