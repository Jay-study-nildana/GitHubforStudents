# Essential Software 

Note: windows users need not install this before coming to workshop. we can do this in the class, no problem.

Note: Mac people, YOU HAVE TO INSTALL the tools before coming to workshop. This is because it takes 2 to 6 hours to install XCode. So, you cannot do this after coming to the workshop.
